G               Em             D                     C          G
Almost Heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River. 
G                 Em                    D                           C
Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, 
                G
Blowin like a breeze.

       G              D7         Em        C
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong 
         G             D               C              G
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads. 
 
[Verse 2] 
G                Em                D              C
 All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue  
G
water. 
G                Em                  D                         C
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop 
       G
in my eye.
