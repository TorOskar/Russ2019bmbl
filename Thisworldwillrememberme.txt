[Intro]
F#      C#

[Verse 1]
                       F#
The men in this town
              D
Live and die and are forgotten
                                 C#
And it doesn't seem to scare 'em
                          D
I can't wait to get away
  F#m
Away from the drought
            D
And the homeless and the hungry
                 G#                   C#
Where they talk about foreclosures
         F#m
Every hot and dusty day
Bm          C#         F#m
I don't intend to waste my life 'round here
Bm            C#              F#m
I've got it all mapped out
Bm         C#         F#m
If I can pull just three jobs a year
        D
I'll be rich, I'll have wealth and fame
                               C#
Everyone'll know my name

(Spoken)

                F#7
"Pull three jobs"? What does that mean?
                   D              C#
What do you think it means?

(Sung) [Verse 2]
             F#m                     D
Just like Billy the Kid, and Mr. Capone
                        C#            F#m        D       C#7
Every kid will idolize Clyde Barrow
F#m                               D
One thing, young lady, I guarantee
                G#m             F#m                 D
Is that this world will remember me
                              F#m       D   C#   F#m   D
Yes, this world will remember me
        F#m
Don't you think it's time
              D
That you lost that egg-stained apron
                G#m                      C#
And wore somethin' made of satin
           F#m          D
From a fine Manhattan store
F#m
Yes, I can see you
       D
In a car with your own driver
             Bm
You are headed to your penthouse
C#           F#m
That will overlook the shore
Bm                           C#  F#m
Your face should be up on the silver screen
Bm                       C#     F#m
You've got that 'It Girl' look
Bm          G#m  C#  F#m
I can't believe that you see that in me
  D                        D7
I always I knew I'd be a star
                                        C#
How intelligent you are

[Verse 3]
F#m
We are wasted 'round here
               D
We're too good for this place

                G#m7            C#7    F#m              D7              C#7
We weren't born to live and die in Texas
F#m                              D7
This is my plan, there's no plan B
             G#7              C#7       F#m
And this world will remember me
                                   C#         F#m       D7      C#           F#m
You and this world will remember me
