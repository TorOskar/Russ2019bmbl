Verse:
[F/A] [Bb]       [C][Dm]
I know a place
          [F/A]               [Bb]    [C][Dm]
Where the grass is really greener
[F/A] [Bb]         [C][Dm]
Warm, wet and wild
              [F/A]              [Bb]    [C][Dm]
There must be something in the water
[F/A]    [Bb]            C Dm
Sipping gin and juice
       [F/A]               [Bb]     [C][Dm]
Laying underneath the palm trees
    [F/A] [Bb]                C Dm
The boys break their necks
          [F/A]          [Bb]          [C][Dm]
Trying to creep a little sneak peek

Pre-Chorus:
[C]                  [Dm]
You could travel the world
    [Bb]
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
[C]                  [Dm] 
Once you party with us
         [Bb]
You’ll be falling in love oh Ohohohohoh

Chorus:
[F/A] [Bb]            [C]     [Dm] 
California girls, we’re unforgettable
[F/A]  [Bb]          [C]     [Dm] 
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
[F/A]       [Bb]            [C]             [Dm] 
Sun-kissed skin, so hot will melt your popsicle
[F/A]  [Bb]  [C] [Dm] 
Ohohohohoh,
