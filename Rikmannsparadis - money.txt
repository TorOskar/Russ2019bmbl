Intro:

[Am]  [F7]  [Dm]  [Eaug]  [Am]


Verse:
 [Am]
I work all night, I work all day 
  [E7/G#]                   [E7]          [Am]
to pay the bills I have to pay, ain't it sad. 
   [Am]
And still there never seems to be 
 [E7/G#]                [E7]            [Am]
a single penny left for me, that's too bad. 
                         [Am/G][Bb/F] [F]               [F/E]
In my dreams I have a plan,     if I got me a wealthy man 
 [Dm]                              [B7/D#]                  [E7]
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball. 


Chorus:

[Am]                [B7]            [E7]     [Eaug]      [Am]
Money, money, money,   must be funny   in the rich man's world. 
                    [B7]           [E7]     [Eaug]      [Am]
Money, money, money,   always sunny   in the rich man's world. 
  [Dm]  [E7][A7]                      [Dm]
A ha, a ha.    All the things I could do 
[F7][E][Am]                [Dm]     [Eaug]      [Am]  [F7]
if I had a little money,   it's a rich man's world. 
[Dm]    [Eaug]      [Am] 
  It's a rich man's world.
